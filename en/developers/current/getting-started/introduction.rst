Technical documentation for Tulia CMS
######

The documentation contains technical aspects of the development and development of the Tulia CMS system.
It is directed to backend and frontend developers.

The main reason for creating Tulia CMS were technological deficiencies of popular CMS systems,
and outdated functional features contained therein. Tulia CMS takes them to the workshop,
transforms them to adapt to today's realities and modern technologies. The system was created
to speed up the work of developers on implementation simple websites (without development)
and provide the basis (CMF) for complex platforms CMS/e-commerce/CRM etc.

The system is based on Symfony 6 and PHP 8.1. The threshold to enter the system is defined
by familiarity with Symfony.

Open source
===========

One of the special features of the system is its open source code and the MIT license that allows it
use it for commercial purposes for free.

The project is available on the Github platform, thanks to which everyone can co-create and develop it.
