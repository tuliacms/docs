Content Blocks
============

Thanks to content blocks, themes provide the user with all possible types of content presentation that
are available in a given theme. You can create FAQ, photo gallery, slider, tables... whatever you want.
Each block has its basic data, with which it is created, and then, using the controller and extensions,
it is modified by the user. You will now learn how to create a new theme and how to insert it into the editor.
