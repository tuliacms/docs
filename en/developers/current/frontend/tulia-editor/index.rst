Tulia Editor - Basics
=======================

- :ref:`Blocks<frontend-tulia-editor-blocks>`

Tulia Editor is a visual editor adapted to building website content using ready-made blocks arranged
in sections and columnar GRID. Each theme prepared for Tulia CMS already has ready-made blocks that
can be used to prepare the content of the website. Each block is edited live, which means that you can
actually see what the page with the given blocks will look like, and you can replace the texts or photos
on the fly.
